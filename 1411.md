Variables are pre-generated with
```python
perm = tuple(
    (a, b, c)
    for a in range(3)
    for b in range(3)
    for c in range(3)
    if a != b != c
)
possibleNext = tuple(
    tuple(
        j for j in range(len(perm))
        if all(x != y for (x, y) in zip(perm[i], perm[j]))
    )
    for i in range(len(perm))
)
x = np.zeros(shape=(12, 12), dtype=np.uint64)
for i in range(12):
    for j in possibleNext[i]:
        x[i, j] = 1
```

`py` version runs at ~100ms (~40%). No clue how to optimize this, or how to do this without `numpy`.

Have not implemnted in `cpp` yet.
