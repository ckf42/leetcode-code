No C++ version yet.

Complexity is roughly $n^2 ln n$, currently at ~600ms (~63%). Since binary search is only used to compute `ip` (number of previous terms), we may be able to precompute this with a $n^2$ loop by storing `count[j][diff] = count(nums[j] - diff, nums[:j])` (which shouuld give $n^2$ complexity), but somehow is is slower. Possibly due to memory management but not sure why.
