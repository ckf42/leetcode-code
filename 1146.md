# 1146

`cpp` version ported directly from `py` version.

`cpp` version may improve with these methods:
* in `set`, write to `history[index].back` directly instead of always constructing `Edit` object
* store `set` in a buffer then commit in `snap`
    * this may result in a higher memory io if `set`ting the same index is rare or most `set`s are on new indices
Current code is good enough so these are not used.
