# 2192

Python version is BFS with potentially bad reallocations. Probably a bit slow but still performing quite well.

C++ version with BFS + queue is somehow very slow (~400ms). Top rankers uses DFS + vector with linear search. Same approach is somehow slower, and optimizing with set + copy to vector does not yield much better.
