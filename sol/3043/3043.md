## Question

Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` of integers, find the length of the longest prefix between all pairs `((a, b) for a in arr1 for b in arr2)` when `a, b` are treated as strings.

## Solution

While brute force enumerating all pairs may work when the sizes are small, we can store the (string representations of the) integers in `arr1` in a trie and query each (string representation of) integer in `arr2`, then return the longest depth we have traversed in the trie.
