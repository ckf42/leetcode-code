## Quesion

Given a `n`x`n` zero matrix `mat` and a list of instructions `query` each containing two coordinates `r1, c1, r2, c2`, increment every entry of `mat` in the square area defined by the coordinates `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` by 1, then return the final `mat`.

# Solution

While it is possible to increment all `(r2 - r1 + 1) * (c2 - c1 + 1)` entries manually for each instruction (which would have `O(n^2 * q)` time complexity), we can instead do better by incrementing only the derivative (more precisely, the difference) of the entries, and integrate the differences to recover the matrix. This gives a time complexity of `O(q + n^2)`.
