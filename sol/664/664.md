# 664

## Question

Given a string `s`, find the minimal amount of operations needed to recreate `s` from an empty buffer (of the same size). Each operation fills and overwrites a (continuous) segment of the buffer with the same character.

## Solution

This is similar to 546, which is a DP problem, although this is slightly easier. On segment `[i, j]`, the result `dp[i][j]` is the minimal of `1 + dp[i + 1][j]` and the cost of printing `[i, k - 1]` and `[k + 1, j]` separately (`dp[i][k - 1] + dp[k + 1][j]`) with `i < k <= j` where `i` and `k` can be printed together (`s[i] == s[k]`).
