## Question

On an unordered tree rooted given via a edge list `edges`, consider two pointers `a` and `b`:
* initially `a` is at the root, and `b` is at the given node `bob`
* each time `a` can select a branch to move to, and `b` moves towards the root
* if `a` reaches an unvisited node `node`, the score of `a` increases by `amount[node]`. Same for `b`
    * if `a` and `b` are on the same node, both scores increase by `amount[node] / 2`
* `a` and `b` moves independently until they cannot move anymore

Find the maximal score `a` can attain

## Solution

This is a simple simulation with BFS on `a`. On each iteration, move `b`, then check whether the next node of `a` is visited (by `b`) or is exactly where `b` currently is.

However, since we do not know the parent of each node (`edges` is unordered), we need to do a BFS first to determine the parents.

The performance of the current implementations is quite bad (python: ~220ms, ~65%; cpp: ~190ms, ~44%). Need to improve.

May also be feasible to track the path of `b` and record the visit time. May save a few checks.
