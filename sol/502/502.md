## Question

Given initial capital `w`, find the maximal capital after choosing at most `k` jobs from an array of jobs. Job `i` has a minimal amount of capital `capital[i]` to select and gives a profit `profit[i]`.

## Solution

We will choose greedily the job with maximal profit that is within the profit requirement. To do so, we can sort the jobs in increasing order of `capital`, then track the job with maximal `profit` using a max-heap.
