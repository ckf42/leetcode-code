# 3337

## Question

Give a string `s` of lower case characters, an integer array `nums` of length `26` and an integer `t`, repeat the following operation `t` times, and return the length of the resulting string modulo `1e9 + 7`: 
for each character `c` in the string, replace it with `nums[c - 'a']` many consecutive letters that come after `c` modulo `26`.

## Solution

Unlike Question 3335, the transformation may change the length at each step and `t <= 1e9` is large, so the trick from there (where you only track the index of `'z'`) does not work. However, noting that the characters evolve independently, it is still possible to just track the frequencies of the letters.

Since `t` can be large, iterating `t` many transformation does not work. However, as the transformation only changes the frequencies linearly, we can represent it as a matrix multiplication, and so this becomes a problem of fast matrix powering.

The major issue is number overflowing. Native Python `int` works but is too slow, `numpy` is fast but `np.uint64` does not seem sufficient. Need to handle the overflow efficiently.

Too lazy for a C++ version yet.
