## Question

Given a undirected Markov chain and two nodes `start` and `end`, find the path from `start` to `end` with maximal probability and return this probability.

## Solution

We can see an edge of probability $p$ as cost $-\ln(p)$. Then the problem is a standard shortest path problem. The only thing different is that the final cost need to be converted back to probability.

Algorithm is standard Dijkstra but C++ version is still a bit slow.
