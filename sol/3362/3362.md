# 3362

## Question

Given an integer array `nums` and a list of 2-tuples `queries`, find the maximal number `R` such that after removing `R` many tuples from `queries`, for each remaining tuple `(l, r)` in `queries`, decrementing (by one) every entry `nums[i]` for `l <= i <= r` will make every entry in `nums` non-positive.

## Solution

As suggested by the comment, this is an analog of `3356`, where we track the covering count by tracking the difference and the cumsum.

We consider covering each element one-by-one. For entry `nums[i]` not completely covered, consider all (unused) interval that covers `i`. To minimize the number of intervals used, the optimal ones to use are the ones that cover more entries, that is, the ones that have the largest right endpoint. Choosing enough of such intervals to cover `nums[i]`, similar to `3356`, we update the `diff` and `cumsum` accordingly, then move to the next index.

The selection of the intervals with the largest right endpoint can be done with a heap. Also, as we are considering the indices one-by-one, we can sort `queries` by the left endpoint first, then push them into the heap one-by-one whenever it covers the current index.

This approach gives a good performance, although there may still be room for further improvement.
