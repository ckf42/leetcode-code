## Question

Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, find the `k`th lexicologically smallest integer in the range `[1, n]`.

## Solution

The naive solution is to list all numbers in the range lexicologically, then pick the `k`th one. However, this takes `O(k) \approx O(n)` time and is too slow (as `n` can reach `1e9`).

This idea can be improved by skipping the numbers that cannot be the target. This can be done by counting the number which can be extended from the current selection. (This may better visualized as a trie.)
Suppose the current selection is `23`.
* By appending one digit, this will span `230, 231, ..., 239`
* By appending two digits, this will span `2300, 2301, ..., 2399`
* ...
We can keep adding digits as long as the number is still in range, which will span a bunch of numbers that follows `23` in the lexicological order. If `k`th element falls into this range, then it must be spanned by this process, and we can consider instead `230`; if `k`th element is beyond this range, then we can look at the next selection `24`.
Repeating this we will always be able reach the target. Since the counting can be done efficiently (with `O(ln n)` per selection), and we only need to do at most `10 * O(ln k)` selection, this yields a complexity of roughly `O(ln n * ln k) \approx O((ln n)^2)`, which is much faster.

This can probably be further optimized by tracking when `k`th element falls into range (i.e. how many numbers each additional digit yields), but the current approach is already fast enough.
