## Question

Given `m`x`n` matrix `points`, find maximal `sum(points[r][c[r]] for r in range(m)) - sum(abs(c[r] - c[r + 1]) for r in range(m - 1))` over path `c[0], ..., c[m - 1] in range(n)`, that is a path from top to bottom with maximal sum of entries values, penalized by column distances.

## Solution

This is essentially the same as 1014, except
* no restriction on `j > i`
* there are multiple rows
Beside these, the idea is the same: on each row, apply 1014 to get optimal values of current row with additional restriction that `j >= i`, then iterate backward to cover the case `j < i`. This gives time complexity of `O(m * n)` and space complexity `O(n)`.
