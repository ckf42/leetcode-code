## Question

Given an array `nums` of nonzero integers, find maximal `k` in `nums` such that `-k` is also in `nums`, or `-1` if no such `k` exists.

## Solution

This is a simple application of hash table: for each integer `x > 0`, track if `x` and `-x` appears in `nums`. This can be done with one traversal of `nums` and bit mask as hash table values.
