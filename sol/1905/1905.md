## Question

Given two boolean array `grid1` and `grid2` of the same size, count the number of (vertically and horizontally) connected regions in `grid2` that are also connected in `grid1`.

## Solution

The idea is to flood-fill on `grid2` and only expand a node while it is still connected in `grid1`. If there is a cell that is not connected in `grid1`, we can claim that the whole region in `grid2` does not count, although we still need to visit the rest of the region to exclude it from search later.

The C++ version is a bit slow (~230ms, ~46%). Not sure how to speed up.
