## Question

Given an array `prices`, find the maximal difference `prices[j] - prices[i]` with `j > i`. If this maximum is negative, return `0` instead.

## Solution

Naively enumerating all indices is `O(n)`.

If `j` is fixed, then the question is just to find `i[j]` within `[1, j)` that `prices[i[j]]` is mimimal, but given `i[j]`, it is easy to find `i[j + 1]`: it is either `i[j]` () or `j`. This effectively is a DP problem. Since we only care about the optimal value `prices[j] - prices[i[j]]` instead of the indices `(i[j], j)`, we only need to keep track of the minimal value `b = prices[i[j]]` seen so far and update on new `prices[j]`.

Not sure why but the speed is still quite slow.
