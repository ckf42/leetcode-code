## Question

Given integers `n` and `maxValue`, find the number of sequences `a[1], a[2], ..., a[n]` each in range `[1, maxValue]` such that `a[i + 1]` is a multiple of `a[i]`, and modulo the answer by `1e9 + 7`.

## Solution

Naively, this is DP: if `dp[head][len]` is the number of such sequences of length `len` and starts with `head`, then `dp[h][l] = sum(dp[k * h][l - 1] for k >= 1 and k * h <= maxValue)` with `dp[h][1] = 1`. However, this has time complexity `O(n * maxValue ** 2)`, which is quite bad.

Another idea is to note that, if the last entry of the sequence is `k`, the whole sequence is completely determined on where the prime factors of `k` distributed. More precisely, if `k = p[1] ** e[1] * p[2] ** e[2] * ...` with `p[i]` prime, then we just need to consider where how the `e[i]` copies of `p[i]` distributed. Simple combinatorics implies that there are `comb(n + e[i] - 1, e[i])` possible sequences of the primes, so multiplying the numbers together yields the number of sequences ending in `k`. Summing over all such `k` gives the final answer.

The major issue with this approach is that, on C++, the standard library does not have `comb`, and its value may overflow `long` if computed naively. One mitigation is to note that `1e9 + 7` is a prime, so the computation can be done completely with modulo, with the need to compute the modulo inverse in the formula for `comb`. As it is given that `maxValue <= 1e4`, we must have `e[i] <= 13`, so we can just pre-compute them beforehand.
