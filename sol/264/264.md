## Question

Find `n`th positive integer ("ugly number") that only has `2`, `3`, and `5` as its prime factor.

## Solution

Note that a number `x` is an ugly number if and only if
* `x == 1`; or
* `x` is an ugly number multiplied by `2`, `3`, or `5`

In particular, if `uglyNum` is a list of sorted ugly numbers, then `uglyNum[0] == 1` and `uglyNum` is a merge of 3 sorted lists `(x * 2 for x in uglyNum)`, `(x * 3 for x in uglyNum)`, and `(x * 5 for x in uglyNum)`. This means that the problem is just merging 3 sorted lists (whose entries depend on the current merged result).
