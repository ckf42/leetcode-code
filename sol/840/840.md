Solution is dump and the C++ version is fast enough, but Python version is quite slow. How to speed up?

Naively, encoding the square as one `int` does not seem to improve a lot. Perhaps we just put the whole `list[list[int]]` in a hast table? Also, tracking partial sums may give a boost but the overhead feels troubling.
