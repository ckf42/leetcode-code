## Question

Given `n` workers each with their own `quality` and `wage`, find the minimal cost to hire `k` of them. Each worker must be paid at least their `wage`, and among all `k` hired workers, their pay must be proportional to their `quality`.

## Solution

Since the pay of a worker must be proportional to their `quality`, each (hired) worker must be paid at least `r = wage / quality` amount per `quality` unit. Then the cost of hired workers is `sum(quality[idx] for idx in hired) * max(r[idx] for idx in hired)`. Since some of the hired workers must have the highest `r`, we can calculate the minimal cost for each choice of the worker with highest `r`. This can be done by enumerating workers in increasing order of `r`, then choose `k - 1` workers with minimal `quality` whose `r` is smaller using e.g. a heap.

C++ version is somehow slow (~30ms, ~52%). Can probably go faster with some optimization.
