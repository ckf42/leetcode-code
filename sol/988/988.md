## Question

Given a binary tree of of lower case letters, find the lexicographically smallest string formed from traversing from leaf to root.

## Solution

Traverse the whole tree and keep the minimal string found so far when encountering a leaf. Just keep the suffix and reverse the string if necessary.

Complete traversal is necessary as there is no constrain on where the minimal string may appear: a node with large character may have a shallow subtree where as a small character may have a deep subtree.
