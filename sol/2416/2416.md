## Question

Given an array `words` of (non-empty) strings, for each string `w` in `words` find the number of strings in `words` that `w` is a prefix of.

## Solution

Naively, for each string `w` we need to go through all strings in `words` to check whether `w` is a prefix. Since we are going through a fixed set of strings, we can store them in a trie. To count the number of strings that `w` is a prefix of, we just need to record on each branch of the trie the number of strings that are in the branch, and return this number when we have reached the end of `w`.

Normally, we need to handle the case where (some prefix of) the query string `w` is not stored in the trie. For this problem there is no need to handle this as we are querying the same set of strings we are storing in the trie.
