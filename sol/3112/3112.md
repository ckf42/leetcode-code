## Question

Given a graph as edge list and an array `disappear` on the nodes, find the minimal time to reach each node from node `0`. Node `i` cannot be reached if time surpasses `disappear[i]`.

## Solution

This is just single-source shortest path with an additional constrain that a node cannot be extended if the current cost is too high. A simple modification of Dijkstra suffices.

The current implementation is quite slow. Not sure if we can speed up a bit.
