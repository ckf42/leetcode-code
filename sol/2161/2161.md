## Question

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `pivot`, stably partition the array such that all elements smaller than `pivot` are place before the elements that are exactly `pivot`, and these elements are place before those that are larger than `pivot`, while retaining the relative order in each part.

## Solution

The naive method is to put the elements in each part in their own buffer, then combined all three buffers. This is `O(n)` time and `O(n)` space.

Another approach is to do it inplace, with `O(n ln n)` time and ~~`O(1)` space~~ `O(ln n)` space if we include the call stack (but storing `n` already takes `O(ln n)` space): do a divide-and-conquer, and after working on the subarrays, merge them to one that is in the desired order.

For merging, suppose the array is split into 6 parts: `[a b c][d e f]`, where `a, d` are elements smaller than `pivot`, `c, f` are those larger than `pivot`, and `b, e` are those exactly equal to `pivot`. Then we just need to swap elements to make it `a d b e c f` (with `b e` and `e b` being the same). Currently this is done with 2 array rotations (`a [b c, d] e f -> a d b [c, e] f -> a d b e c f`), which is quite inefficient (python: ~450ms, ~5%).

I do not think it is feasible to do `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.
