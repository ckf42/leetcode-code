# 808

The recursion $a(x, y) = (a(x - 4, y) + a(x - 3, y - 1) + a(x - 2, y - 2) + a(x - 1, y - 3)) / 4$ with boundary condition $a(x, y) = \begin{cases} 1 & x \leq 0,\, y > 0 \\ 0 & x < 0,\, y \leq 0 \\ 1 / 2 & x \leq 0,\, y \leq 0 \end{cases}$ is simple, but coming up with that cheesy shortcut abusing the `1e-5` tolerance is quite hard.

Still haven't found the closed form.
