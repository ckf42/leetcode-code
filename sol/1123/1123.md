## Question

Given the root of a binary tree `root`, find the lower common ancestors of all leaves that have the maximal depth.

## Solution

Since there could be multiple deepest leaves, the easiest way may be to start from the leaves and go back to the root, and this can be done with post-order traversal.

More precisely, at each node we compute recursively
* the distance to the deepest leaves in this subtree
* the lca of the deepest leaves in this subtree
which can be done by computing these at the two subtrees, then comparing the two distances. If the distances of the two subtrees are the same, the lca of this subtree must be the subtree root; in other case it is the lca of the larger distance.
