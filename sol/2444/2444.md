## Question

Given an array `nums` and two integers `minK` and `maxK`, find all continuous subarray of `nums` that has the minimal value `minK` and maximal value `maxK`.

## Solution

This is typtical two-pointer: given the right end of the subarray, find how far left the subarray can be extended to such that the conditions are still satisfied.
To count the number of valid left endpoint, we need to track where the elements in `nums` exceeds the allowed range, and where `minK`, `maxK` occur. The valid range is simple that after the first out-of-bound value and before (proceeding) the last (rightmost) `minK`, `maxK` value.
