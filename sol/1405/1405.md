## Question

Given `a` many letter `'a'`, `b` many letter `'b'`, and `c` many letter `'c'`, find the longest string that can be formed from these letters such that no letter appears consecutively 3 times. If there are multiple such string, find either one. If no such string can be formed, return the empty string.

## Solution

The approach is to choose the next letter greedily, by always choosing the valid letter with the maximal amount left, which can be done with a heap. Although the maintenance overhead would be significant, in Python the overall performance still appears fine.

No C++ solution yet. There should be a good way to manage memory better than just throwing everything in a vector.
