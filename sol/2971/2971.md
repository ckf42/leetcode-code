## Question

Given an array `nums` of integers, find the largest perimeter of the polygons formed with elements in `nums` as the side lengths.

## Solution

As noted in the question, numbers `a[1], ..., a[k]` in increasing order form a polygon if `a[1] + ... + a[k - 1] > a[k]`, or equivalently `a[1] + ... + a[k] > 2 * a[k]` where LHS is exactly the perimeter. Note that this depends only on two things: the sum `a[1] + ... + a[k]`, and the maximal element `a[k]`. Moreover, if `a[1], ..., a[k]` satisfies the requirement, and `b` is not larger than `a[k]`, then `b, a[1], ..., a[k]` also satisfies the requirement.

These mean that we can choose greedily, by first sorting `nums` and calculating the total sum, then removing the largest elements until the condition is satisfied.
