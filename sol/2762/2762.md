## Question

Given an integer array `nums`, find the number of (continuous) nonempty subarray where the maximal and the minimal value differ at most by 2.

## Solution

Since we are counting subarrays, a simple idea is to use sliding window. However, to check if the window is still valid, finding max/min values requires `O(l)` time, which makes the whole algorithm `O(n^2)` time.

The major issue is in tracking the max/min values: removing an element from the window will change max/min values in a nontrivial way. If we are able to track max/min in `O(1)` time, the whole algo is `O(n)`. To do so, we can use monotone stack: store monotone sequence in a deque, and when removing the edge element, check if we should pop from the queue. This gives (amortized) constant time.

However, this approach does not appear to be good enough: python ~700ms, ~50%; C++ ~120ms, ~55%. The more naive python `dict` and C++ `O(n^2)` retracking seem to perform better. Need to optimize code.
