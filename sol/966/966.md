# 966

Currently the algorithm is just brute force storing all variants into hash tables. Performance is ok but we are still storing too much. There should be a smarter way to do this.

We could indeed just loop through whole `wordlist` and check each variant, or try to store everything into one table, but the time performance would probably deteriorate too much.

No C++ version yet.
