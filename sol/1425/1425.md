## Question

Given an integer `k` and an array `nums`, find the maximal sum of elements in its subsequence. The subsequence must be chosen such that two consecutive terms in the subsequence are at most `k` apart in index in the original array `nums`.

## Solution

This is a DP problem: if `memo[j]` is the maximal sum of subsequence that ends at index `j`, then `memo[i] = max(0, max(memo[j] for j in range(i - k, i))) + nums[i]` (`0` is that the subsequence consists only of `nums[i]`). The final result is then `max(memo)`.

Naively implementing this would give time complexity `O(n * k)` which degenerates to `O(n^2)` on `k = O(n)`. To speed up the computation, we will put the elements in a monotonic stack in decreasing order (so that the maximal value is always at the bottom of the stack) and keep track whether the bottom of the stack is still within `k` limit. This can be done if we implement it with a deque.

Particularly, we push elements to the tail of a deque and (a) pop front if the front element is beyond the `k` limit (b) pop back if the back element is smaller than the current element.
