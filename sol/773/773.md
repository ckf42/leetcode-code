# 773

## NOTE

Performance is quite bad (python: 7ms, ~70%). Need to speed up first. 

Standard A* does not seem to be faster. In fact, simple BFS appears to have a better performance, possible due to cost to maintain heap.

Since there are only 720 possible inputs, it is possible to precompute all 720 results and store everything in a ~~hashmap~~ array, encoding the board as permutation index. The performance is fast (0ms, 100%) but it is basically cheating.
