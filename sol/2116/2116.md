## Question

Given a string `s` consisting of `'('` and `')'` and a string `locked` consisting of `'0'` and `'1'` of the same length, decide whether `s` can be made as matching parentheses when characters where the corresponding `locked` entry is `0` can be flipped.

## Solution

`s` is a valid matching if and only if the following two conditions hold:
* for every prefix, the number of `'('` is greater than or equal to the number of `')'`
* the total number of `'('` and `')'` matches

To track these two conditions, we may iterate the string once and keep track of the possible range of `[number of '('] - [number of ')']`. This can be done by tracking `upper` bound and `lower` bound of the range.
If during the iteration `upper` is negative, then there are more `')'` than `'('` and so `s` cannot be matched.
On the other hand, if `lower` is negative, there are too many (prospective) `')'` that no `'('` afterward can match them, in which case some of the wildcards has to be changed to `'('`. This can be done with `lower %= 2`.

Judging from others' answers, it seems that `lower %= 2` can be replaced with `lower = max(0, lower)`. Not sure why but it should be (slightly) faster than modulus.
