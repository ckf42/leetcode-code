## Question

(Omitted)

## Solution 

The description is long but it comes down to counting tuples `(a, b)` with `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m` such that `a + b` is odd.

Since of the sum of two integers is odd if and only if one is odd and the other is even, so we just need to
* count the tuple where `a` is even and `b` is odd
* count the tuple where `a` is odd and `b` is even
The math is then a simple computation.
