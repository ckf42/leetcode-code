## Question

Given a list `points` of 2D integer points, find the minimal lengths of edges needed to connect all points. The length of an edge between two points is calculated via L1 distance.

## Solution

This is typical minimal spanning tree problem, with the graph being a complete graph given by all pairs of points.

The typical algorithms for spanning tree is
* Kruskal's algorithm, which uses union-find
* Prim's algorithm, which uses heap
Either algorithm works, but Prim appears work (slightly) better, perhaps because Kruskal requires sorting all edges beforehand and so always requires `O(n^2)` while Prim requires only edges when needed, giving a marginally better performance.
