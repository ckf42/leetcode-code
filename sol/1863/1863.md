## Question

Given an array `nums` of integers, find the total sum of xor over all possible subsets of `nums`.

## Solution

Since the question asks for xor over all subsets, let us consider when a certain bit will appear in the xor results.

First of all, a bit can be present in one of the xor results iff some element of `nums` has that bit set. Suppose over all `n` elements in `nums`, exactly `k` many of them have the bit set (and `n - k` do not). If we select a subset that contains an odd number of these `k` elements, the xor would have the bit set. So, it suffices to count how many subsets contain an odd number of such elements. Since the other `n - k` elements doe not interfere with the xor, we just need to count the number of choices among these `k` elements.
By some simple math, we can see that there exactly `2^(k - 1)` of the `2^k` choices that contains an odd number of such elements, so sin total there are `2^(n - 1)` subsets that will yield the bit. This implies that the total sum is just `sum(bit * 2 ** (n - 1) for bit in set_bit) = total_OR * 2 ** (n - 1)`.
This is approximately `O(n)` in time (to compute total bitwise or, and compute `2 ** (n - 1)`), which is much faster than the naive `O(2^n)` brute force.
