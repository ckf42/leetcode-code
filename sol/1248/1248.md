## Question

Given an array `nums` of integers and an integer `k`, find the number of continuous subarray that contains exactly `k` odd numbers.

## Solution

Record the indices of odd elements. Then for each continuous segment of `k` indices, we just need to compute the number of choices of starts and ends that the corresponding subarray contains exactly these `k` indices. To do this, we can put the indices in a queue and count whenever we have `k + 1` indices in the queue.

Alternatively, to find the number of continuous subarrays that contains exactly `k` odd numbers, we just need to find the number of subarrays that contains at most `k` odd numbers, and the number of subarrays that contains at most `k - 1` odd numbers. The answer is then the difference of these two numbers. To find this, we can use two-pointer approach: keep track of feasible start and end, and update on new elements.

For C++, these two approaches seems to have similar performance, although the top rankers all seem to use the difference approach with a faster implementation. Not sure how to improve the code.
