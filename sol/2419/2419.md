## Question

Given an array `nums` of integers, among all (continuous) subarrays that has the largest bitwise AND, find the length of the longest one.


## Solution

Note that the AND of two elements is always no larger than the original two elements, and is strictly smaller unless the two elements are the same. This means that, the subarray with the largest AND must be the subarray that contains only the largest element in `nums`.

This reduces the question to finding the maximal length of the subarray that consists only of the maximal element in `nums`, which can be done on `O(n)` time.
