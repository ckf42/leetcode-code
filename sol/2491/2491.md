## Question

Given an positive integer array `skill` of even size `n`, split the array into `n // 2` groups of equal sum and compute the sum of products of elements in each group, or return `-1` if impossible to have such splitting.

## Solution

Since in a valid splitting the smallest element in `skill` must be grouped with the largest element, we can sort the array and always pair the first elements with the last elements. This gives a time complexity of `O(n ln n + n) = O(n ln n)` (dominated by sorting).

Alternatively, as the range of possible elements is small (`1 <= skill[i] <= 1000`), we can count the frequencies of each element in `skill` and do the same pairing. While this should give a time complexity of `O(n)`, the C++ implementation does not seem to have a better performance than the sorting one, perhaps due to the fact that the size of the array is small `n <= 1e5` and so the extra cost in sorting the array is comparable with the overhead on the frequency approach.

We can possibly use a (ordered) map to record the frequencies, but then the time complexity would fall back to `O(n ln n)` (assuming map has time complexity `O(ln n)` for each operation). Have not really implemented one though.
