## Question

Given an array of integers `answers` of size `n`, find the smallest integer `m >= n` such that we can group `0, ..., m - 1` into disjoint groups and for `i < n`, `i` is in a group of size `answers[i] + 1`.

## Solution

As suggested by the comment, it is easier if we solve 1282 first.

For that question, `m = n` is given, and the question asks to find one such grouping. The idea is to use greedy, by simply grouping the elements that reports the same group size.

For this question, the idea is similar: we are still grouping elements that reports the same size as one group, but in view of elements `n, ..., m - 1`, we may not be able to put the elements into precise groups, and we need to add new elements to make the grouping work. So, if there are `k` elements (in `answers`) that reports a group size of `m`, there must be in total `ceil(k / m) * m` elements. Summing everything up yields the final answer.
