## Question

Given a list `folder` of (absolute resolved) unix-like directory paths, find all paths that is not a subdirectory of other paths in `folder`

## Solution

The first instinct is to store the paths in a trie, then traversal the tree to get the parent directories.At least in python, this approach turns out to be fast but not fast enough (~67ms, ~77%), possibly due to the memory management for all the trie nodes and the additional trie traversal.

The second approach as suggested by the hint is to sort all paths lexicologically, then take the paths that is not a suffix of previous path (with an additional `/` to ensure subdirectory relation). This turns out to be quite fast (python ~20ms, ~98%), even with relatively simple code in c++ (42ms, ~97%).

Time complexity-wise, the trie approach needs to
* enumerate every character in every string once (to build trie)
* query elements in trie node hash table (to build trie)
* traverse trie once (to find parent directories)
* enumerate every character in every parent directory string once (to rebuild parent directories)
while the sorting approach needs to
* sort the strings
* enumerate every character in every string once (to check suffix)
* enumerate every character in every parent directory string once (to check prefix)

This means that sorting the strings is far faster than querying the hash tables in trie and traversing the whole trie, which may be a bit surprising as sorting the strings may be slow if the strings are long (in worse case, each comparison requires enumerate the strings once, with total cost `L n ln n` where `n` is the number of strings and `L` being the total length).
