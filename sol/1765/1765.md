## Question

Given a `m x n` binary matrix `isWater`, return a matrix `height` of nonnegative integers with the same size such that
* `height[i][j] == 0` if `isWater[i][j] == 1`
* a cell must have absolute difference at most `1` with its 4 neighbours
and if there are multiple such matrices, return the one with the largest maximum.

## Solution

A naive idea is to bfs the matrix starting with the cells where `isWater` is `1`. Since we are taking entries greedily, this guarantees that the maximum is largest.

Somehow the performance is quite bad (py: ~900ms/60%, cpp: 111ms/20%). Need to improve.
