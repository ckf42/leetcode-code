## Question

Given a string `s` and a list `dictionary` of strings, find the minimum number of characters to remove from `s` such that `s` can be decomposed into substrings all of which are in `dictionary`.

## Solution

The basic idea is to use DP. If `dp[i]` is the minimum number of characters to remove from `s[i:]`, `dp[i]` is the minimum of
* `dp[i + 1] + 1`, in the case that `s[i]` is to be discarded for the optimal choice
* `dp[j + 1]` for each `j >= i` such that `s[i:j + 1]` is in `dictionary`

The check on whether `s[i:j + 1]` is in `dictionary` can be done quickly by putting strings from `dictionary` in a trie. This also allows early break when no strings can be matched.

Time complexity is about `O(n^2 + sum(w_i))` where `n` is the length of `s` and `sum(w_i)` is the total length of strings in `dictionary.`
