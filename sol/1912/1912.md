# 1912

Pulled off a few tricks to cache results and it is quite fast, but the design is horrendous.

Currently, report is generated on demand (with `heapq.nsmallest`) which iterates over the whole list and build the heap. May be possible to do this in [constant time](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47894452).

No C++ version yet until I have a better design.
