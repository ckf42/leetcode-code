## Question

Given two strings `start` and `target` which are of the same length and consist only of `L`, `R` and '\_', determine if it is possible to move letters in `start` and transform it into `target`. The only possible moves are
* change `_L` into `L_`
* change `R_` into `_R`

## Solution

By the definition of the moves, we can see that for the prefixes at the same index, 
* there cannot be fewer `L` in `target` than in `start`
* there cannot be fewer `R` in `start` than in `target`
* if `start[i] == 'L'`, the numbers of `R` in both prefixes must match
* if `target[i] == 'R'`, the numbers of `L` in both prefixes must match

So we just need to maintain the count of `L` and `R` and scan the strings together while checking for this conditions.

It turns out that (at least for python) the performance is not good (~115ms, ~75%), probably due to bad branching. Need to rewrite it for better performance.
