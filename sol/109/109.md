## Question

Given the head `head` of a sorted linked list, return a balanced binary search tree on the same elements.

## Solution

Naively, we can keep finding the median element with `O(n)` walk, then recursively build its subtrees, but this would give complexity `T(n) = n + 2 T(n / 2)` and so `T(n) = O(n ln n)`, which is good but not good enough.

The major issue in this approach is that we need to repeatedly walk on the list to find the median element. However, this is not really necessarily: after we build the left subtree, the first element remaining must be the median element; and if we already know the length of the whole chain, we know recursively the sizes of each (left) subtree.

So the more efficient approach is
* find the total length of the chain
* build the left subtree with the correct number of elements
* skip the first node remaining and build the right subtree
* combine the subtrees with the skipped node into a tree
The subtrees can be built recursively as we only need to know its size (which we can obtain with `O(1)` with the size of the previous level).

Finding the total length requires `O(n)` time, and building the subtrees requires `T(n) = 1 + 2 T(n / 2)` and so `T(n) = O(n)`. In total the time complexity is just `O(n)`, which is faster than the naive method and is (asymptotically) optimal.
