# 546

Could not figure out the algo without checking [others' notes](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-boxes/solutions/101310/java-top-down-and-bottom-up-dp-solutions). Algo is DP with complexity `O(n^4)`, but code is still very slow (Python: ~4000ms, ~9%, C++: ~136ms, ~30%).

Not sure how to speed up the algo. Apparently there is another approach, but not sure how.
