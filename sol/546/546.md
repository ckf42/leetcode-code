## Question

Given an array `boxes` of integers, find the maximal points achievable by removing continuous segment of elements of the same value. Removing `k` elements of the same value gives `k ** 2` points.

## Solution

Could not figure out how to solve it without checking [others' notes](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-boxes/solutions/101310/java-top-down-and-bottom-up-dp-solutions). Algorithm is DP with complexity `O(n^4)`, but code is still very slow (Python: ~4000ms, ~9%; C++: ~136ms, ~30%). A quick optimization is to group elements of the same values first, which gives a good improvement (Python: ~570ms, ~80%; C++: ~30ms, ~90%).

See the above link for the algorithm.
