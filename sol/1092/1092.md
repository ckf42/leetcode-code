## Question

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, find the shortest string that contains both `str1` and `str2` as substrings (not necessarily continuous).

## Solution

This is classic DP: if `dp[i, j]` is the length of such string for `str1[:i + 1]` and `str2[:j + 1]`, then
* if `str1[i] == str2[j]`, `dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1`
* otherwise `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1, j] + dp[i, j - 1]) + 1`
which gives the length of such string in `O(n1 * n2)` time.

To reconstruct such string, we can walk back from `i, j` according to the table and insert the character that fits the min requirement.
