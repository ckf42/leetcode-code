## Question

Given an undirected tree with edge list `edges`, node values `nums`, and an integer `k`, find the maximal node sum of the whole tree if it is allowed to choose an arbitrary number of edges and changes the node values of the edges from `x` to `x ^ k`.

## Solution

Since the graph is a tree, it is connected and so by xor'ing the whole path, we can select two arbitrary nodes and changes their values. So, it suffices to find all pairs of nodes that when xor'ed yields a positive sum. This can be done by storing the xor changes, sorting, and taking the pairs with such positive sums.

There seems to be a faster approach. Need to figure out.
