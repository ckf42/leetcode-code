## Question

Given an array `stones` of 2D integer coordinates, find the maximal number of coordinates that can be removed from it. A coordinate can be removed if there is another coordinate (still) in the array that shares the same row or the same column.

## Solution

If we connect coordinates by this "remove" relation, we can see that in each connected component we can remove at most `size - 1` coordinates: keep removing the one with fewest edges.

So the problem is just counting the sizes of connected components. Using union-find does not seem to improve a lot (esp. for Python) compared to dfs traversal.
