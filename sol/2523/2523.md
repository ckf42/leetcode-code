## Question

Given integers `left` and `right`, find the pair `p1, p2` of primes with `p1 < p2` in the range `[left, right]` that has the smallest different and the smallest `p1`.

## Solution

The basic idea is to find the primes in this range, then enumerate them all to find the one with smallest difference. This is the worst code I have written in a while.

The other approach is to skip building the prime table and test primity for the integers in the range one-by-one. One such test is Miller-Rabin and is much faster than the prime table appraoch.

Too lazy to do the C++ version.
