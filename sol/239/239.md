## Question

Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, find all sliding window maximum for windows of size `k`.

## Solution

The idea is to use a monotone *queue*. Since we want to track the running maximum, we store in the queue the decreasing sequence. Then the maximum is at the front of the queue.

To update the window, we need to remove the element that falls off the window. Since this element must be in the front of the queue (if it is in the queue), we need to use a deque.

It is possible to use [a general approach](https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2024/11/27/stacks-queues.html), but the performance seems a bit worse. (Python: 655ms, ~6%; compare with ~150ms, ~80%.)
