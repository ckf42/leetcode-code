## Question

Given an array `nums`, find the minimal amount operations needed to make elements in `nums` unique. Each operation increment a chosen element in `nums` by `1`.

## Solution

The idea is simple: just increment the smallest duplicated elements. Since we can only increment elements, in the optimal procedure the smallest duplicated elements must be incremented at least once. When such smallest elements are incremented, we have one more unique element, which reduces the size of `nums` to consider by one. As the increments are all necessary, repeating this procedure until there is no more duplicated elements will give us the optimal procedure.

Instead of actually modifying `nums`, we can just record the frequencies of the elements in `nums`, and alter the frequency record directly. This can be done by enumerating `freq[i] for i in [1, max(nums))`. While a more sophisticated approach (e.g. track and enumerate only the range set) may yield a better performance, this direct enumeration is already fast enough.
