# 1420

Classic dp. Recurrence is
``` 
dp[arrsize, cost, maxval] =
    dp[arrsize - 1, cost - 1, 1] + ... + dp[arrsize - 1, cost - 1, maxval - 1]
    + dp[arrsize - 1, cost, maxval] * maxval
```
with obvious boundary condition and modulo arithmetics. Question asks for 
``` 
dp[n, k, 1] + ... + dp[n, k, m]
```

Currently `py` version is direct implementation and is ~940ms (~50%) and ~24MB (~55%). Can be optimized by
* iterate on `arrsize` and iterate on `maxval` backward
* compute total sum and update on iteration
* output the last total sum directly
These should reduce space to O(k * m) and potentially to O(m).

Too lazy to do at the moment. Will come back someday.
