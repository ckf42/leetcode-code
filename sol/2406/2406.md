## Question

Given a list `intervals` of closed intervals, find the minimal number of groups that can be formed by partitioning `intervals` such that no two intervals in the same group intersects.

## Solution

The basic idea is to append new intervals from the list greedily. On a new interval `itv` we choose to put it in the group which has the maximal separation with other intervals, so that it is the most unlikely to have intersection, or a new group if every existing group intersects with `itv`. For this to make sense, we can sort `intervals` according to the first element `itv[0]` of each intervals, then track the maximal element in each group. With this approach, we can find out the group with maximal separation by storing the maximal elements in a min-heap.
