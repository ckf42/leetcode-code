## Question

Given an integer matrix `grid` and an array `queries`, for each `query` in `queries` find the number of entries in `grid` (adjacently) connected to the `grid[0][0]` entry and has value strictly smaller than `query`.  (If `grid[0][0] >= queries`, the number should be zero.)

## Solution

Since `queries` is given already, we can process the queries in increasing order and progressively floodfill `grid` to count reachable points. However, naive floodfilling has bad performance (py: ~9500ms).

The main issue is that not all terminal points in the last floodfill is a good starting point of the current floodfill: we just need to look at the points that are smaller than the current `query`.

There are two ways to handle this:
1. floodfill with a heap, and only take the points that are smaller than `query` (same as shortest path)
2. store all previous terminal points in a heap, then on new floodfill, only starts at those smaller than `query`
Both approaches are quite performant, although in the first approach we would need to spend more time maintaining the heap (while in the second the floodfill can be done with almost no maintain cost).

There also seems to be a disjoint-find approach. Haven't got it yet.
