## Question

Given `n` and `k`, find one permutation of `(1, 2, ..., n)` such that "the absolute difference between neighbouring elements" have exactly `k` elements.

## Solution

If we are able to find a permutation of `(1, ..., k + 1)` such that every absolute difference is unique (so exactly `k` differences `1, ..., k`), then by appending `k + 2, ..., n` to the end of this list, we have a desired permutation: the tail part only gives absolute difference `1`, and the boundary part gives `k + 2 - l` for some `l in [1, k + 1]`, which must be in `1, ..., k` and so appears in the head part already.

A quick brute force on small `k` yields the following pattern: excluding the trivial case `k == 1`,
* on even `k`, the entries on the even indices are in increasing order and starting from `1`, and the entries on the odd indices are in decreasing decreasing
    * e.g. on `k == 6`, one permutation is `1, 7, 2, 6, 3, 5, 4`
* on odd `k`, the entries on the odd indices are in increasing order and starting from `1`, and the entries on the even indices are in decreasing decreasing
    * e.g. on `k == 7`, one permutation is `8, 1, 7, 2, 6, 3, 5, 4`

A quick proof also justify this construction. So we just need to construct this permutation.
