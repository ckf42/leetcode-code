## Question

Given an array `values`, find maximum of `values[i] + values[j] + i - j` with `j > i`.

## Solution

Classic DP: given that the optimal value on fixed `j` appears at `i[j]`, we can find `i[j + 1]` is either `i[j]` (with value `values[i[j]] + i[j] + values[j + 1] - j - 1`) or `j` (with value `values[j] + j + values[j + 1] - j - 1`), so it suffices to keep track of the maximal `values[i] + i` and update both this and the global optimal on new index `j`.

No sure why the the speed is still quite slow.
