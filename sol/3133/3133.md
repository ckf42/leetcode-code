## Question

Given positive integers `n` and `x`, find `n` positive integers `nums[0:n]` such that

* `nums` is strictly increasing
* bitwise `and` of all elements in `nums` is exactly `x`

and return the smallest `nums[n - 1]` possible for such `nums`.

## Solution

If we do not have the `and` constrain, the smallest possible `nums[n - 1]` is obviously `n - 1` (from array `[0, 1, .., n - 1]`). Since we have the bitwise `and` condition, on where the (binary) digit of `x` is `1`, every element in `nums` must have a `1` in the corresponding place. This means that we can only vary the (binary) digits where `x` has a `0` at.

This leads to the following approach: we write the digits of `n - 1` on the `0`-digits of `x` (starting from the least significant digits).
