## Question

Let `grid` be a `2 x n` matrix of positive integers. A walk is a connected path that connects `(0, 0)` and `(1, n - 1)` and moves only to the right or to the bottom (positive directions). If we are allowed to first choose a walk and set all entries on it to zero, find the maximal sum a second walk can get if the first walk minimizes this sum.


## Solution

After the first walk, the first row can only have a suffix remaining, and the second row a prefix, and they can be identified by where the first walk turns to the second row. This means that the second row must either collect only the suffix of the first row or the prefix of the second.

The algorithm is then to compute iteratively these prefixes and suffixes, and find the one where the maximal of the two is minimal.

Not sure why but the same solutions submitted on 2025/01 has a better performance than on 2024/08 (python: 78ms/811ms, cpp: 2ms/120ms). Performance is still kind of bad though.
