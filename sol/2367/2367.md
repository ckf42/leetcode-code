## Question

Given a strictly increasing array `nums` and a number `diff`, count the number of indices `i, j, k` with `i < j < k` and `nums[j] - nums[i] == nums[k] - nums[j] == diff`.

## Solution

Noting that the elements are distinct, we can simply enumerate one of the indices and use monotonicity to prune the search space: if currently `nums[j] > nums[k] - diff`, `j` is already too large; similar for `i`. In the implementation, we enumerate the last index `k` and advance `i` only when a matching `j` is found. Time complexity is about `O(n)` as each of `i, j, k` may go through the whole array once.

We can also store the entries in hash table and check on each element if the corresponding indices exists.
