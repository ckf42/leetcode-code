## Question

Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, determine if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1` as a (continuous) substring.

## Solution

Easy to see that string `a` is a permutation of string `b` if `a` and `b` are of the same length and they have the same frequencies for each characters. So to check if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1` as a substring, we just need to check on each substring of the correct size if it is a permutation of `s1`.

To do so, we can consider a sliding window of length `len(s1)` and count the characters in this window. To move to the next window, we just need to handle the entering character and the exiting character. In total, the time complexity is `O(len(s1) + len(s2))`.
