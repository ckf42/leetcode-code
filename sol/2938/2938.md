## Question

Given a string `s` consisting only of `'0'` and `'1'`, find the minimal swap of adjacent elements to make all `'0'` appear before `'1'`, that is to make `s` be of form `'0' * k + '1' * l`.

## Solution

It is easy to see that a swap sequence consisting only of `10 -> 01` is optimal, so it does not matter the order of swapping (as long as it is valid). This means that we can consider the problem iteratively: to swap `s`, we just need to swap `s[:-1]`, then swap to put `s[-1]` at the correct position (if `s[-1] == '0'`).

To swap the last `'0'` in `'0' * k + '1' * l + '0'` in the correct position, we need to bubble up the last `'0'` by swapping `l` times, so we just need to keep track of the number of `'1'` in the processed part.
