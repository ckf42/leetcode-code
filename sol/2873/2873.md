## Question

Given an array `nums`, find the maximal value of `(nums[i] - nums[j]) * nums[k]` for `i < j < k`. If it is negative, return `0` instead.

## Solution

By the structure of the value, we need to keep track of the maximal difference `nums[i] - nums[j]` up to each index `k`. The maximal value is then the maximal of `maxDiff * nums[k]`.
To find the maximal difference, we can track the maximal element up to each index `j`, and the max difference is just `maxEle - nums[j]`.
So, we just need to iterate `nums` once, and update in order
1. `maxVal` as max of `maxDiff * nums[k]`
2. `maxDiff` as max of `maxEle - nums[k]`
3. `maxEle` as max of `nums[k]`
The order is to ensure that `j < k`.
