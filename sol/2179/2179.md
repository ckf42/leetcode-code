## Question

Given two permutations `nums1` and `nums2` of `0, ..., n - 1`, find the number of pairs `x1, x2, x3` such that on `nums1[pi] = xi` and `nums2[qi] = xi` we have `p1 < p2 < p3` and `q1 < q2 < q3`.

## Solution

As suggested by the hint, we can just count for each `p2` the number of `p1` and the number of `p3` that satisfies the condition, which can be done by storing the locations of elements in `nums2` and enumerating `p2`. Once the number of `p1` is obtained, the number of `p3` can be obtained without enumerating the array again.

However, this has complexity `O(n^2)`, and given that `n \leq 10 ** 5`, this will TLE.

The major bottleneck is in counting the number of `p1` for each `p2`, that is counting for each `p2` the number of `p1` such that `q1 < q2`.
Since we are enumerating `p2` in order, after we have processed a `p2` we can mark `q2` as seen. Then the counting is just computing the number of elements that we have seen before, which is a concurrent prefix sum / update problem and can be solved with [Fenwick tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenwick_tree). Simply copying the implementation on wiki is already sufficient to solve this problem.
