## Question

Given a "boolean expression" `expression`, return its evaluation.

A string is a "boolean expression" if and only if it is of the following form:
* `t`
    * its value is true
* `f`
    * its value is false
* `!(e)` where `e` is a "boolean expression"
    * its value is the negation to that of `e`
* `&(e1)` or `&(e1,e2,...,en)` where `e1`, ..., `en` are "boolean expression"
    * its value is the conjunction of all `e1`, ..., `en`
* `|(e1)` or `|(e1,e2,...,en)` where `e1`, ..., `en` are "boolean expression"
    * its value is the disjunction of all `e1`, ..., `en`

## Solution

Obviously, the correct way is to write a parser. Here, we write a recursive descent-like parser. Since there is no obvious hierarchy, we put all the parsing in one subroutine. In each parsing part, we check which type of the branch `ptr` is pointing to, parse the current subexpression recursively, then move `ptr` to the character after the current subexpression. As guaranteed by the question, `expression` is a valid "boolean expression", so there is no need to check for invalid input.

The common approach seems to be a stack-base parser. However, this would require maintaining additionally memory, while the recursive descent parser maintains only a single `ptr`, which leads to its great performance (~7ms for Python).
