## Question

Given a string `expression` of (simple) fraction arithmetics, return the result of evaluating the computation in a string. Only addition and subtraction are included, and each fraction is given as a ratio between two integers separated by `/`.

## Solution

This is just a simple string parsing. Find the location of the first `/`, which gives the numerator of the next fraction. Find the location of the first non-digit character, which would gives the denominator. The rest is just simple bookkeeping.

Can probably use Python `Fraction` module for improvement. I do not have time at the moment, so the code is unoptimized and there is no C++ version yet.
