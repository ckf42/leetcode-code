## Question

Given a binary 2D grid `grid` of size `n x n`, find the maximal size of 4-connected groups of `1` if at most one of the `0` can be changed to `1`.

## Solution

The idea is simple:
1. floodfill to find all connected group
2. assign a unique id to each group and propogate it to each cell of the group
3. for each cell of `0`, check the id of its neighbouring cells and compute the size of the new group if this cell is changed to `1`
In total, this is 2 bfs (one for finding group, one for propagating id) and one traversal (to check `0` cells), so `O(3 n^2)` in time.

Current implementation requires a `n x n` grid to store cell id, `O(n^2)` array to store group sizes, and a set (of max 4 elements) to sum neighbouring groups. Probably can go faster if we use dict of dicts or more complicated structures.

Too lazy for C++.
