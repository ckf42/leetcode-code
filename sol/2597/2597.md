# 2597

This is a bad algo (~2.4s, `O(2^n)` time and space complexity). DP should solve this but not exactly sure how.

Editorial sol splits nums into sorted remainder classes that ensures the violating element is always the neighbouring one. Not sure if it is good.

No C++ version before a better algo is found.
