## Question

Given positive integers `n`, `limit`, find the number of (non-negative) partitions of `n` into 3 parts such that each part is at most `limit`.

## Solution

This is a combinatorial problem and can be solved recursively:
* if there is only 1 part, there is `1` partition if `n <= limit`, `0` otherwise. Let `f1(n) = 1 if n <= limit else 0`
* if there are 2 parts, then the total number of partitions is `sum(f1(n - l) for l in range(0, min(n, limit) + 1))`. Doing some algebra, we have `f2(n) = max(0, min(n, limit) - max(0, n - limit) + 1)`
* if there are 3 parts, then the total number of partitions is `sum(f2(n - l) for l in range(0, min(n, limit) + 1))`

While naively implementing this works, the performance is horrible. Doing more algebra, we can split the computation into various cases, depending on whether `n < limit`, `n < limit * 2`, `n <= limit * 3` hold or not. Simplifying this under different cases, we obtain a quick implementation.
