## Question

Given a string `s` of even length consisting of equal amount of `[` and `]`, find the smallest number of swaps needed to make the brackets balanced.

## Solution

We first remove all matching brackets from `s` as they should not affect the swapping. In order not to introduce new unmatched brackets (`[][]` -> `][` by matching the first with the last), we greedily match the brackets when enumerating `s`, which can be done using a stack. Since we are only working with two types of characters, we can just emulate the stack by tracking the number of `[` and `]` seen so far.

Since `[` and `]` are of equal number, the remaining string must be in the form of `']' * a + '[' * a`. If we always swap the first `]` and the last `[`, except in the case `a = 1` it will always create 2 matching pairs (which is the maximal one swap can do) and reduce the string to `']' * (a - 2) + '[' * (a - 2)`. 

So the number of swaps needed `s(a)` satisfies `s(1) = 1` and `s(a) = 1 + s(a - 2)`, and thus `s(a) = (a + 1) // 2`.
