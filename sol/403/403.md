## Question

Given a strictly increasing array `stones` of integers, determine if it is possible for a frog to get from the first element to the last one.

The following rules is imposed for a walk:
* the frog can only jump to a later element in `stone`
* the size of the first step is exactly `1`
* if the step size of the previous jump is `k`, then the next step size must be one of `k - 1, k, k + 1`

## Solution

Intuitively this is a DP problem: if `(x, y)` is the last jump (with `x, y` being elements in `stones`), then we just need to enumerate possible `z` so that `(y, z)` is feasible. This can be done by first enumerating the index `j` of `y`, then enumerating all `i < j` for `x`.

However, the performance is quite bad. This is possibly because, for a given index `j`, only a small number of index `i` (compared with `O(j)`) can make `(stones[i], stones[j])` feasible. This can be improved by storing for each `j` the set of possible indices `i` and only enumerate from this set. This is already a big speedup, but the performance is still subpar, possibly due to the overhead of maintaining the sets.

We can also see this as a connectivity problem, on whether there is a path from `(0, 1)` to some `(x, stones[-1])`, in which case can be solved with a simple graph traversal. It turns out that this gives a much better performance (than simple DP). It also appears that a DFS is better than a BFS, both in time (with a 6-fold speedup) and in space.
