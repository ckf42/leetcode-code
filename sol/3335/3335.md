## Question

Given a string `s` and integer `t`, repeat the following process `t` times and find the length of the resulting string modulo `1e9 + 7`: for each character `c` in the string,
* if `c == 'z'`, replace it with the string `'ab'`
* otherwise, replace it with the next character in the alphabet

## Solution

The first idea is to model this as the modulo ring `ZZ[X] / <X ** 26 - X - 1>`, then the final length is just the sum of coefficients in the polynomial `P_{orig} * X ** t` in the reduced form, where `P_{orig}` is the polynomial presented by the string `s`. While one can compute `X ** t` as `(1 + X) ** q * X ** r` with `q, r = divmod(t, 26)`, tracking the (reduced) coefficients turns out to be quite troublesome, and computing the binomial coefficients would still take `O(t // 26) = O(t)` time anyway.

The naive approach is then to simply iterate the multiplication with the monomial `t` times, which is still feasible as by assumption `t <= 1e5` is small. Since the polynomial multiplication is just shifting except for `X ** 25`, this can be done efficiently by storing the coefficients in a (fixed size) array, then changing and tracking the index that represents the coefficient of `X ** 25`.
