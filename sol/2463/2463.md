## Question

Given a list `robot` of (unique) 1D robot locations and a list `factory` of factory (location, capacity), pair each robot to a factory such that
* each factory `factory[i]` is paired with at most `factory[i][1]` robots
* the total distance of between a robot and its paired factory is minimized
and return the total distance.

## Solution

This is a DP problem.

Easy to note that if `robot[i] < robot[j]` and `factory[k][0] < factory[l][0]` (with enough capacities), then pairing `(i, k), (j, l)` is better than pairing `(i, l), (k, j)`. This means that the pairing should be made in increasing order of both robot and factory locations, and we should sort both first before processing.

For simplicity, we may assume that all factories have capacity 1 (which can be done by repeatedly counting the factories). For `robot[i]`, on a given `factory[j]`, either
* it can be matched with `factory[j]`, and have `robot[i + 1:]` match with `factory[j + 1:]`; or
* it can skip `factory[j]` and find its match in `factory[j + 1:]`

so on `dp[i, j]` being the minimal cost of matching `robot[i:]` with (factories from) `factory[j:]`, we have the recursion formula `dp[i, j] = min(dp[i + 1, j + 1] + abs(robot[i] - factory[j]), dp[i, j + 1])`, with boundary conditions `dp[len(robot), j] = 0` (no more robots to pair) and `dp[i, j] = infty` if `len(robot) - i > len(factory) - j` (not enough factories to pair with).

If we naively implement this with a 2D memory, then (at least for Python with `functools.cache`) we would have Memory Limit Exceeded. Note that in the recursion computing `dp[i, j]` requires only knowing `dp[k, j]` and `dp[k, j + 1]` with `k >= i`. So, we only need 1D memo to store `dp[:, j]` on the current `j`, enumerating `j` from `len(factory) - 1` to `0`, `i` from `0` to `len(robot) - 1`.
