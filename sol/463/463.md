## Question

Given a binary array `grid` with size `row`x`col`, compute the perimeter of the region formed by connecting `1` horizontally and vertically (island). It is assumed that there is only one island.

## Solution

Each `1` contributes 4 units to the perimeter unless it is neighbouring another `1`. To count the overlap, on each cell it suffices to count one connection per axis (e.g. left and up).
