## Question

Given an array `chalk` of integers and an integer `k`, find the first index where `k` becomes negative after subtracting elements in `chalk` in cycle, that is after subtracting `chalk[-1]` we begin again at `chalk[0]`.

## Solution

The direct approach is to enumerate the process and subtract the numbers repeatedly. However, we can speed up the process by taking modulo by the sum of `chalk` first. This avoids uncessarily enumerate `chalk`. After the modulus, a direct enumeration is enough. This process needs to enumerate `chalk` twice. Not sure if we can do it in one go.

A potential improvemeny is to do binary search on prefix sum, which would need only `n + ln n` time complexity instead of `n * 2`. Not sure how fast the speed up is exactly.
