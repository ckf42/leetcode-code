## Question

Given a list `favorite` of integers in `[0, n)`, find the longest number of integers in `[0, n)` that can be arranged in a circle such that every integer `i` in the circle has a neighbour that is `favorite[i]`.

## Solution

Consider the (directed) graph defined by `i -> favorite[i]`. As hinted by the hint, a valid construction must be one of the following:
* a loop of length at least 3
* (disjoint) loops of length 2 of the form `a -> b -> a` together with paths `a <- (!= b) <- ...` and `b <- (!= a) <- ...`
So we need to find
1. every loop in the graph
2. if loop of length 2, the tails extended from each loop point

To find the loops, we just need to do Floyd's tortoise and hare on each point. To find the tails, bfs on each loop point.

Currently the implementation is 
1. find all endpoints of tails that do not have any node pointing to them
2. for each such point, tortoise and hare to get the loops
3. for every point not visited which must be in a loop with no tail, walk through the loop
4. for every loop of length 2, bfs on each loop point
5. count the loops of length 2 from step 3, and sum with step 4

It seems that the performance is a bit bad and should still have room for improvement. Too lazy for C++ version.
