## Question

Write a list-like data structure that supports
* (`append`) appending element at the end
* (`getIndex`) accessing the element at the given index
* (`addAll`) adding a constant to all elements in the structure
* (`multAll`) multiplying a constant to all elements in the structure

All arithmetic operations are done in modulus `M = 1e9 + 7`.

## Solution

A naive idea is to apply `addAll` and `multAll` on each element in the list, but each operation would then be $O(n)$.

Noticing that, after appending `x`, `addAll(inc)` changes it to `1 * x + inc` and `multAll(m)` changes to `m * x + 0`, we can see that it will always have the form `a * x + b` for some `a, b` determined by all calls of `addAll` and `multAll`, so we just need to keep track of such `a, b`.

One issue is that these `a, b` is not uniform on the whole list, as `addAll` and `multAll` does not affect the elements that are `append` already. It would be much easier if all `append`s appear before `addAll` and `multAll`. One way to do this is to pretend that the element was appended in the beginning: on `append(x)`, instead of append `x` to the list, we append `y` such that `aCurr * y + bCurr == x`. Since `M == 1e9 + 7` is a prime, we can always solve for such `y` as `y = (x - bCurr) * pow(aCurr, -1, M)`.

An optimization is to track also `aInv = pow(a, -1, M)` instead of computing it on every `append`, which would require updating `aInv = aInv * pow(m, -1, M)` on `multAll(m)`. Noting that `m` is restricted in a small range (`[1, 100]`), so we cal also precompute all `pow(m, -1, M)`.
