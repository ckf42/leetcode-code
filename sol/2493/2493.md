## Question

Given an integer `n` and a list `edges` of undirected edges on nodes `1, ..., n`, find the maximum numbe of groups the nodes can be grouped into if adjacent nodes must be put in adjacent groups.

## Solution

Consider first the graph is connected. Then it can be grouped iff the graph is bipartite, and the maximal number of groups that can be formed is the diameter of the graph.

This means that we can consider each connected component separately, and compute the diameter of each one.

The diameter can be computed in `O(V^2)` time (unlike tree which can be computed in `O(V)` times).

Too lazy for a C++ solution. The Python solution is somehow bad in performance (~2200ms, ~24%). Need to optimize.
