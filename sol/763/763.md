## Question

Given a string `s` of lower case characters, partition it into as many parts as possible, such that no two parts has a common character.

## Solution

The basic idea is to track where a character appears last, which can be done by traversing the string once. For each part, if it contains character `x`, it must contain everything up to `lastOccur[x]`.
This means we can construct the parts iteratively: starting a new part, and propose the end to be `end = lastOccur[x]`. Then, iterate to till we reach `end`, we update `end` to contain `lastOccur[y]` for each character `y` we see. This gives a valid part.

While the algorithm is (asymptotically) optimal as it only runs in linear time, it seems that the performance is not quite good. Instead of construct each part and iterate the content, it seems to run better if we simply iterate the whole string and only construct parts when the condition is met.
