## Question

Given an integer `num`, find the maximal number that can be formed by swapping two digits at most once.

## Solution

Trivially, we want to swap a small digit with a large digit on the right (less significant place), and if there are multiple choices, we should choose the rightmost digit.

This leads to a simple method:
* for each digit, we find the largest digit on its right
* starting from the left (most significant place), we check if the largest digit on its right is larger than the digit itself. If so, swap and return
This guarantees that we are choosing greedily and should yield the optimal solution.

Instead of storing all indices of largest digits first, we can combine these two steps into one: iterate from the right and update the index of the largest index, then check if swapping with the current digit can make a larger number. The last such swap would be the desired swap.
