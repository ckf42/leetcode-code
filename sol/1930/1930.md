## Question

Given a string `s`, count the number of unique subsequence of length `3` that is a palindrome.

## Solution

Since we only care about palindrome of length `3`, it must be of form `aba` where `b` is a character that can be the same as `a`. So, we just need to count the number of unique characters appears between a repeated pair.

To do so, we track the indices that each letter appears in `s`, then for each letter, we
* check if the letter appears at least twice
* count the number of characters that appears between the first and the last occurrence

To count the last one, we can enumerate the whole alphabet and binary search for the indices.

## NOTE

Would a simple linear search on `s` faster?
