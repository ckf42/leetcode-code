## Question

Given an array of sorted arrays of integers, pick two integers from different arrays and find their maximal absolute difference possible.

## Solution

Since the arrays are sorted, we only need to care about the first and the last elements of each array. The obvious choice is to take the maximal last element and the minimal first element, but it is possible that they are in the same array.

To handle this, we can do one of the following approaches:
1. Keep track of the 2 maximal last elements and the 2 minimal first elements, and if the maximal last and the minimal first are from the same array, we take either the maximal last and the 2nd minimal first, or the 2nd maximal last and the minimal first
2. Keep track of the maximal last and minimal first seen so far. On seeing a new array, update the maximal difference by computing the differences of respective pairs, then update the maximal last and the minimal first

While the second approach sounds faster then the first (with fewer things to keep track of), somehow for Python the first approach is faster.
